          ❝ Everything that you thought had meaning: every hope, dream, or
          moment of happiness. None of it matters as you lie bleeding out on the
          battlefield. None of it changes what a speeding rock does to a body,
          we all die. But does that mean our lives are meaningless? Does that
          mean that there was no point in our being born? Would you say that of
          our slain comrades? What about their lives? Were they meaningless?
          They were not! Their memory serves as an example to us all! The
          courageous fallen! The anguished fallen! Their lives have meaning
          because we the living refuse to forget them! And as we ride to certain
          death, we trust our successors to do the same for us! Because my
          soldiers do not buckle or yield when faced with the cruelty of this
          world! My soldiers push forward! My soldiers scream out! My soldiers
          RAAAAAGE! ❞
